# RelevantTextSearch
Given a document and a search query, this program uses different relevancy measures to find the most relevant chunk of text in the document.

The different relevancy measures used here are:
Cosine Similarity
Okapi Method

In Progress:
Bayes Relevance method.

Tf-Idf modelling is used to build these relevancy scores.

Built a trie to calculate TF and IDF.
We can use an out of box solution like lucene or solr to do this. I wanted to practice building a trie :)
